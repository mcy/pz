## Contributing

This project uses [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev) and VS Code to provide a deterministic development environment for contributors.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a way to run Docker containers on your host workstation (or use GitHub Codespaces). If you're using MacOS, we recommend [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima).
